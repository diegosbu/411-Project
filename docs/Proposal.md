Main Project Pitch:
Have you ever had trouble finding a restaurant to eat at? Maybe it’s hard to decide between vague names like “Bob’s Diner” and “The Grill”. We want to create a web application that shows you a variety of generic dish images like “burgers” or “shrimp scampi”. Swipe left and right till you’ve found your one true craving. Then, once you’ve decided, it provides a list of restaurant recommendations close to you that serve the dishes you want. It will utilize Yelp and BU Dining APIs to do so Even better, try our Friend mode, which helps groups of friends decide where or what to eat by providing the restaurants that have dishes everyone likes.

Secondary Project Pitch:
This web app combines the FBI crime data API, Airbnb API, and TripAdvisor API. The application will allow users to choose from hotels and airbnb properties that are analyzed by their crime data in a given location. This ensures that users are able to know beforehand the safety of the neighborhood they may be staying in. It also allows users to view various pricing options in a given neighborhood. Safety and affordability will be at the fingertips of users.
