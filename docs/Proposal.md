Have you ever had trouble finding a restaurant to eat at? Maybe it’s hard to decide between vague names like “Bob’s Diner” and “The Grill”. We want to create a web application that shows you a variety of generic dish images like “burgers” or “shrimp scampi”. Swipe left and right till you’ve found your one true craving. Then, once you’ve decided, it provides a list of restaurant recommendations close to you that serve the dishes you want. It will utilize Yelp and BU Dining APIs to do so Even better, try our Friend mode, which helps groups of friends decide where or what to eat by providing the restaurants that have dishes everyone likes.
